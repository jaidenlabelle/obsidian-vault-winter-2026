_Please consider your personal strengths and weaknesses. What strengths do you have that could lead to entrepreneurial success? What weaknesses do you have that might impede your success if you were to embark on an entrepreneurial path?_ (100 words)

Strengths:
- Willingness to learn and try new things.
- I can pour tons of time into projects that I am interested in.
- I have lots of experience in many technologies, different programming languages, Linux and Windows, 3d printing, soldering, wiring, etc. That could come in handy when inventing a new product or considering the difficulty of creating a product.
- I have friends who are programmers or in IT that would be able to help me.

Weaknesses:
- I tend to drop projects when I lose interest in them.
- I tend to get overwhelmed when a solution is not clear or straightforward.
- I have a busy schedule and cannot invest a lot of time into entrepreneurial pursuits. 

_Please reflect on your response to changes. Would you consider yourself to be change-adverse or do you embrace change (or somewhere in between)? Please reflect on your reactions when something goes wrong. (100 words)

I would consider myself to be someone in between embracing change and being change-adverse. I find it easier and usually more enjoyable to use technology and methods I already know, but I am willing to try new things, especially if it could lead to better outcomes, and that's usually enjoyable as well.

My reaction when something goes wrong is usually either frustration or confusion depending on what it is, then I will try to figure out exactly what, when, and why it went wrong, and then try to come up with a solution to the problem, usually by using Google.
